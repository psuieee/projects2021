### About
This GitHub repository is for the archival and distribution of materials for the Penn State IEEE workshops from Fall 2021 and Spring 2022. Check in releases for files required for workshop attendance.

### Contributing
When contributing to any of the worksohps in this repository, we ask that you make the changes in a fork of the repo and make a pull request to merge into the relevant workshop's branch once the feature is completed. Workshop branches will be merged into *main* only once work on a branch's particular workshop has completed. Any non-complex file additions, such as presentation slides or worksheets, may be committed directly to workshop branches.
